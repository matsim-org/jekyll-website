Somewhat unfortunately, the actual, automatically generated website and the material from which it is generated are intertwined.

An attempt to sort some of this out:

_site -- the actual, auto-generated, website

Everything else is input (I think) from which the above is auto-generated.

index.html -- home page

benchmark
authors
archive.md
about-matsim.md
open-scenario-data.md
javadoc.md
about-us.md
the-book.md
signups.md
gallery
downloads
conferences
docs
extensions.md

-- This is all material that in the end is called as matsim.org/abc .  Note that in some cases we have abc.md, in some other cases we have abc/index.html.  Presumably, the latter should only be used for more complicated renderings; in practice, I think it rather depends on history.

The jekyll build states:

Configuration file: /Users/kainagel/git/jekyll-website/_config.yml
            Source: /Users/kainagel/git/jekyll-website
       Destination: /Users/kainagel/git/jekyll-website/_site

Implies to me that we should try to move the source material into some "src" folder.

The forwards are in .htaccess, but that file is not shown in IntelliJ.
