In this scenario, air traffic over Europe is simulated using MATSim. The model was created by [VSP, TU Berlin](http://www.vsp.tu-berlin.de/) based on data provided by OAG Aviation.

It can be nicely seen how air traffic increases around 5:00 A.M. (GMT), which corresponds to 6 A.M. in most central European countries: the time the ban on night flights is lifted at many airports.

The model is currently being improved to take capacity constraints at airports, like runway capacities, into account.
