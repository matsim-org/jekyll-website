In this work, we introduce our approach to build a digital twin of the transportation in 
the medium-sized city of Birmingham, Alabama, USA. 
This digital twin is a transportation simulation model that incorporates transportation 
modes such as public transits and ride-hailing services, in addition to 
private vehicles that constitute the majority of Birmingham’s traffic. 
With this digital twin, transportation engineers can flexibly analyze the impact of 
ride-hailing services under different scenarios, 
such as “if the number of Uber drivers doubles” which could happen in the near future.
