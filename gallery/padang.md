With MATSim it is possible to simulate large-scale evacuation scenarios. In a running project Last-Mile Evacuation we are developing an evacuation simulation for the Indonesian city of Padang, which faces a high risk of being hit by a tsunami. The estimated advance warning time before an earthquake-triggered tsunami reaches the shore line is about 30 minutes. That means the evacuation needs to be very fast. A realistic simulation of the evacuation process would help to give an estimate of the evacuation time, to detect bottlenecks in advance and to identify highly endangered areas, where a vertical evacuation seems the only way.

The movie shows preliminary results of the evacuation simulation. The simulation starts 28 min before the tsunami reaches the shore line. It is assumed that all people are at home (“evacuation at 3 a.m.”).
