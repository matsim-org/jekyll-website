In this example, we generated a synthetic population of commercial vehicles (mainly freight) on a national scale in South Africa. The activity chains were generated using a path-dependent complex network of connectivity (paper pending). The concept of using complex networks to describe commercial vehicle movement was originally addressed in [Joubert & Axhausen (2013)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11116-012-9439-0).
