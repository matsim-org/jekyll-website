The MATSim scenarion for the Munich metropolitan area was set up during the year 2010. The goal is, among others, a simulation of local and global air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions and how these levels change with respect to different policy measures. Network information from VISUM was linked to travel demand from different sources: an activity-based demand for inner-urban traffic came from the survey "Mobility in Germany" (MiD, 2002). Commuters and reverse commuters are modeled based on data provided by the German Federal Employment Office. Freight traffic is also introduced in the model by using data from the German Ministry for Transport.

Emissions are calculated every time a vehicle leaves a street, and is dependent on the engine type, age, cubic capacity as well as the traffic state (free flow or stop & go). This video shows, for the city of Munich, a spatial distribution of NO2 exhaust emissions over time of day. Emission levels are calculated for every street and aggregated for 30 minutes time bins. Using a Gaussian smoothing function allows to identify areas with the highest emission levels.
