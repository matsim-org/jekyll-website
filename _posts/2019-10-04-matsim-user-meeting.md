Dear MATSim community,

this year the annual MATSim user meeting will be in Warsaw, Poland. The meeting occurs on April 6th, just a day before the ANT conference, which begins on Tuesday, April 7th.

We are now accepting submissions for the User Meeting from both Science and Industry. Submissions for the User Meeting should take the form of an abstract (< 1000 words), and are to be submitted before 29th February 2020, through EasyChair.

MATSim-related submissions to the main conference will as well be considered for inclusion in the User Meeting program. Please feel free to forward this information to any of your contacts, by sharing the link to the EasyChair call for papers:

Registration for the User Meeting will be announced in the close future.

We are looking forward to seeing you in Warsaw!
