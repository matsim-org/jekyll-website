The blog on Confluence is now deprecated. Due to continued breakages caused by
Atlassian/Confluence changes, we’ve decided to move the MATSim news blog directly
onto the MATSim website. We have been mirroring these posts onto the website for
a long time anyway, so now everything will be in one place.

We continue to welcome MATSim-related news items, job postings, and event announcements.
Now, you’ll submit news by creating a pull request on Github.com with the content of your
news item in Markdown format.

- Explicit directions for submitting news items: see <https://matsim.org/submit-news>
- And if those instructions aren’t clear enough just let us know!

Thank you! Hopefully this transition will be straightforward.
